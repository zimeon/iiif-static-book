# iiif-static-book

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

Aim is to create a simple program that will generate a set of static tiles and a manifest for a set of images of a book. Based on:

  * Static tile generation: <https://github.com/zimeon/iiif/blob/master/iiif_static.py>
  * Manifest generation: <https://github.com/iiif-prezi/iiif-prezi/blob/master/examples/build-from-directory.py>
